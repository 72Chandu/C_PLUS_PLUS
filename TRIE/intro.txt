A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve strings, especially useful for:
Autocomplete systems
Spell checking
Prefix searching

Each node in a Trie represents a character of a word.
Each node has:
A map or array of child nodes (for each possible character).
A boolean flag to mark the end of a word.
Root node is empty ("").
Insert/Search/Delete operate in O(length of word) time.
